/*
 * Notes:
 * Upgrade Tree:
 * --- Skill tree idea: Mana Control
 * --- Initially you can swap mana and they move back if no match
 * --- Swap a mana up to two positions
 * --- Swap a mana up to three positions
 * --- Place your own trio of mana (random)
 * --- Place your own duo of mana (random)
 * --- Place your own mana (random)
 * --- Place your own mana (choose color)
 * --- Move a mana anywhere you want
 *
 * --- Matches = units
 * --- Matching units = upgrade
 *
 * --- Skill tree idea: Unit controll
 * --- Choose the upgrade path instead of it being randomgit
